# Information
When Missionchiefbot was shut down in January, a group of users came together to try and revive it.  A  former user reached out to the original developer who was unwilling to release the code.  With that being a dead end, we created new code, keeping with the intent of the original.  Subscriptions help us develop new features and retain our programmers who take our ideas and put them into use.
